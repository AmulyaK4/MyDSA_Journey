Given an array of integers nums, return the second-largest element in the array. If the second-largest element does not exist, return -1.

Examples:
Input: nums = [8, 8, 7, 6, 5]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The largest value in nums is 8, the second largest is 7
Input: nums = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation:
The only value in nums is 10, so there is no second largest value, thus -1 is returned

Python:
class Solution:
    def secondLargestElement(self, nums):
        largest = nums[0]
        for num in nums:
            if num > largest:
                largest = num
        second_largest = -1
        for num in nums:
            if num != largest and num > second_largest:
                second_largest = num
        return second_largest
