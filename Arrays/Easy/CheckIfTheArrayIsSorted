Problem Statement: Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.

Note: Two consecutive equal values are considered to be sorted.

Example 1:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: True.
Explanation: The given array is sorted i.e Every element in the array is smaller than or equals to its next values, So the answer is True.

Python:

class Solution:
    def check(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        drops = 0                 [DROP: In a non-decreasing sorted array, every element is less than or equal to the next element,A drop happens when an element is greater than the next element]
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] > nums[(i+1) % n]:
                drops += 1
                if drops > 1:  
                    return False
        return True
